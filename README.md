-  I’m a recent bootcamp alumni of the School of Code (v5.0 in Q1 of 2021)
-  Focus on Javascript, React and C#, with a few extras sprinkled in along the way!
-  Hoping to continue to improve these skills in a suitable job role, and learn new ones along the way.
-  Employment history in disability /third sector. Supported people to improve their lives, now working to improve my professional acumen.
-  Portfolio in development. In the meantime, feel free to take a look round.
